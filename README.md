# blockchain-explorer

React App to fetch blocks and transactions from the Ethereum chain, and we can also connect the Metamask wallet with it.

### About
The app is made with React, Javascript, MUI, Web js, Metamask. 

At first, you can get the block by using any random number and then fetch transactions using the fetched data. Firstly the fetched data is from the Node made on the Quick Node Ethereum client node, after connecting the Metamask wallet different blocks will be fetched through the Metamask provider. (you can check it by fetching block no. 1 before & after connecting the Metamask wallet).
